# unicode-samples
samples of unicode files in various formats.

The following files are taken from the original author, see
https://github.com/QbProg/unicode-samples :

- utf7.txt
- utf8.txt
- utf8-bom.txt
- utf16le.txt
- utf16le-bom.txt
- utf32le-bom.txt

The following five files were added by me, converting the original files:
- utf16be.txt
- utf16be-bom.txt
- utf32be-bom.txt
- utf32le.txt
- utf32be.txt

Those files cover the most common unicode variations, and may help to test
unicode tools.

The original author didn't choose any license, so feel free to use it.
